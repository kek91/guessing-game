# guessing-game

Figured it was time to get familiar with Rust. Based on the tutorial from the Rust book: http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/guessing-game.html


### Install instructions:


Please note you must have Rust installed with the cargo package manager.

Download here: https://rust-lang.org


- clone repo
- run `cargo build` and run the resulting binary in target dir
- or run `cargo run` to build and run the binary automatically in current terminal
